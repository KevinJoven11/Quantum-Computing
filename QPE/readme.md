# Quantum Phase Estimation - Code by Kevin J. Joven

This code implements the quantum phase estimation algorithm for the hydrogen two systems $H_2$. This file used some of the codes that are presented in the same repo, such as the Pauli decomposition and the trotter formulas.

In short, you can see the following plot that shows how the eigenvalues are calculated based on the number of precision qubits (ancilla qubits that increase the precision of the algorithm)!
