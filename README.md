# Quantum-Computing

This repository is about some codes in quantum computing, the most known.

## 1. Quantum Tomography (2x2 matrices). ![LaTeX](https://img.shields.io/badge/COMPLETE-30%25-orange)

This is the code for quantum tomography on one qubit system. In which we want to replicate any density matrix of one qubit.

* Do the same for the two-qubit system.

## 2. Pauli Decomposition (NxN matrix). ![LaTeX](https://img.shields.io/badge/COMPLETE-100%25-blue)

This code is for finding any the Pauli decomposition gives any matrix.

## 3. Parameter Shift Rule - Qiskit Implementation & Pennylane validation. ![LaTeX](https://img.shields.io/badge/COMPLETE-100%25-blue)

You can find the step by step of calculation of the parameters shift rule with an example of calculating the lowest value of a matrix. Also, validate the result using Pennylane, a library focused on quantum machine learning.
