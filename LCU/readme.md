# Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU)

## This repository builds step-by-step (file-by-file) the entire circuit of LCU.

The LCU circuit can be designed as the following image.

The different building blocks, prepare (Prep.) and select (Selec) are developed in different files. Each implements the following design strategy, as shown in the following two figures.

Combining them, we can implement the LCU circuit, which, in our case, will be the building block of a more complex quantum circuit (Hint: QSVT).

Feel free to leave any questions!
